# Blog 1 - Backend Part 1

I'm really bored. Quarantine sucks. So I'm going to do something really boring and make a blog.

Why am I doing this?
Um, I don't really know.

## Tech Stack

For my first project, I used MongoDB - that was a bad idea. Joins in MongoDB can be a pain, so this time I'm going to use MySQL. OK let's start defining models... wait what's this sequelize thing?

OK sequelize(https://...) looks perfect for this project! Sequelize is a ORM (Object Relational Mapper) which will take care of my models for me. It's just like mongoose is to MongoDB.

So for this project I'll need a few models: Users, Blogs, Tags

-   node, express
-   mysql
-   react, context

-   dotenv
